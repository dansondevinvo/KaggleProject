# KaggleProject

This repository shows machine learning in metastatic healthcare for the Kaggle project.

Overview
The task, as defined by the Kaggle challenge, is to predict the likelihood of metastasis in cancer patients using medical data. The dataset consists of various clinical and genomic features, and the goal is to classify whether a patientâ€™s cancer will metastasize. The approach in this repository formulates the problem as regression task, using Logistic regression to predict and also used data preprocessing techniques like handling missingvalues and scaling numerical features. My best model had an accuracy of 61% which is pretty low for submissions on Kaggle.
